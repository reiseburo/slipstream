topics:
  - name: 'test'
    # Using the `key` allows JSON messages to self-describe the schema
    # with which they should be validated.

    # This will *only* be valid for a root key. This is to avoid the
    # need to do extra parsing and searching within each message.

    # THe routing configuration can be used to route the messages after
    # validation to additional Kafka topics for consumption.
    #
    # Using the `$name` placeholder will substitute the originating
    # topic's name, for example valid messages on "test" will be routed
    # to "test.valid"
    routing:
      # Passed validation
      valid: '$name.valid'

    # topic will be validated against the specific schema definition

      # The keys under `routing` are optional, omitted entries will
