# This is an example of a slipstream configuration.

# It is used for testing, but also serves documentation

  # The configuration is passed directly through to librdkafka

# The schemas must be a directory containing .json or .yml files which
# describe JSON schemas
schemas: './schemas.d'

topics:
  - name: 'test'
    # Using the `key` allows JSON messages to self-describe the schema
    # with which they should be validated. 
    #
    # This will *only* be valid for a root key. This is to avoid the
    # need to do extra parsing and searching within each message.
    schema:
      key: '$id'
    # THe routing configuration can be used to route the messages after
    # validation to additional Kafka topics for consumption.
    #
    # Using the `$name` placeholder will substitute the originating
    # topic's name, for example valid messages on "test" will be routed
    # to "test.valid"
    routing:
      # Passed validation
      valid: '$name.valid'
      # Failed the defined schema
      invalid: '$name.invalid'
      # Could not be deserialized as JSON
      error: '$name.error'

  # Slipstream topic mappings can be chained to allow for secondary schema
  # validation, i.e. "this message wasn't valid for v2 of the spec, what about
  # v1?"

    # topic will be validated against the specific schema definition
    schema:
      path: 'pings/v1.yml'
    routing:
      # The keys under `routing` are optional, omitted entries will
      # result in messages not being routed under certain conditions
